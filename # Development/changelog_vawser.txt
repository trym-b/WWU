# TODO

Faction Issues:
- Randomness for leadership succession, should allow player the ability to more deterministically control leadership
- Better info on faction point gain/loss
- Horde: kalimdor invites shouldn't be allowed before the Horde has significant presence in EK
- Horde: cannot invite non-Draenor members when on Draenor
- Alliance can spawn independant of Horde
