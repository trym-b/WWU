They eventually defeated the Burning Legion. "
 darnassian_ideas_3: "The Sundering and the World Tree"
 darnassian_ideas_3_desc: "Malfurion and the three dragons made a pact that the night elves would serve as guards of this new well. Alexstrasza brought an enchanted acorn, a remnant of G'hanir, and placed it in the well, where it grew into Nordrassil, the first world tree. This tree would serve as a means to regulate the power of the new Well masking its energies ingeniously from radiating out into the Twisting Nether to serve as another beacon for the Legion. The tree would also mask its power signature from would-be magic users in the hope of preventing any other society from learning arcane secrets and repeating the disastrous error of the elves. The tree would forever serve as a symbol of the connection between the arcane and nature, the night elves and the natural world, and would use the energies from the well to heal the world after the devastation of the Sundering. Partly in reward for their effort in repelling the Legion invasion, Nozdormu then blessed the world tree, so that as long as the tree stood, the night elves would never age or fall prey to disease. Green Aspect Ysera have also placed an enchantment upon the World Tree by linking the spirits of the night elves to her own realm, the ethereal dimension known as the Emerald Dream. The night elf druids, including Malfurion himself, were bound to the Dream through the World Tree. As part of the mystical pact, the druids have agreed to sleep for centuries in the emerald dream, so that their spirits could roam the infinite paths of Ysera's Dreamways and the spirits of the night elves. Though the druids were wary of losing so many years of their lives to hibernation, they agreed to uphold their bargain with Ysera"
 darnassian_ideas_4: "The Long Vigil"
 darnassian_ideas_4_desc: "Tyrande Whisperwind, high priestess of Elune, had become the leader of the night elf populace. For thousands of years, she led the night elves in their vigil.

However, whenever a crisis came, the druids would awaken. One such crisis came from the remaining Highborne. Due to their narrowmindedness over the period of the long vigil the night elves saw little to no major advances"

 darnassian_ideas_6: "Break the Isolation" 
 darnassian_ideas_6_desc: "After the third war, the night elf nation also joined the Alliance, though the exact moment at which they joined is unknown. They were apparently motivated to do so by the continued logging operations of the Horde in Warsong Gulch. As a result of the Third War, corruption and madness had taken hold of many of the night elves' former lands and allies, severely weakening the strength of the night elf nation. As members of the Alliance, the night elves partook in multiple conflicts."

 thalassian_ideas_1_desc: "#The first king of the High elves Dath Remar Sunstrider led the exile of the highborne and set the way for a dynasty that would rule Quel'Thalas for millennia, it is said that while a Sunstrider holds the throne Silvermoon has nothing to fear."
 thalassian_ideas_2: "Highborne Exiles"
 thalassian_ideas_2_desc: "The Highborne soon grew bold in defying the new laws against arcane magic. They would not bow to the hysterical fears of the lower-caste majority. The Highborne felt they had taken all the necessary precautions by resolving to be more cautious than their predecessors. After all, the Highborne had no desire to bring about another Sundering. Rather than execute the Highborne, the rest of the night elves sentenced them to exile after they had unleashed a terrible magical storm over Ashenvale. The Highborne were thoroughly exasperated by what they saw as a foolish overreaction against sorcery. They were therefore not unhappy at the prospect of exile; on the contrary, they looked forward to it. Thinking ahead, they contrived to steal one of the magical vials that had been confiscated from Illidan"
 thalassian_ideas_3: "The Sunwell"
 thalassian_ideas_3_desc: "The Sunwell empowered the high elves for roughly seven thousand years to come. Its presence in their lives was comparable to eating or breathing. In the Sunwell's light, Quel'Thalas grew mighty, becoming a beacon of power in the Eastern Kingdoms. Yet, the boons it granted were not without a price: the high elves, constantly bathed in the Sunwell's power every moment of every day, became addicted to its energies. Here it shall be. We will have our glory again, and this will give it to us. So much power... The power of the Well of Eternity, transformed with our guidance into something greater yet - Dath'Remar Sunstrider"
 thalassian_ideas_4: "Bandinoriel and the Runestones"
 thalassian_ideas_4_desc: "Some times after the founding of Quel'Thalas, many of the high elves grew wary of their rampant use of arcane magic, fearing that it could once more draw the Burning Legion to Azeroth. Dath'Remar Sunstrider sent his most powerful arcanists to find a solution. Over several decades, they built a series of monolithic runestones around Quel'Thalas' borders. This barrier was called Ban'dinoriel, or 'the Gatekeeper' in the high elven tongue. It would prevent others from detecting the high elves' use of magic, ward off the superstitious Amani, and weaken the magic of all non-elves within it."
 thalassian_ideas_5: "Azerothian Diplomacy"
 thalassian_ideas_5_desc: "For nearly four thousand years, the high elves remained relatively at peace. But while the elves established their nation, the Amani plotted their next assault. 2,800 years before the First War, they unleashed it upon the high elves. The Troll Wars ignited. Suffering loss after loss, the high elves turned to the humans of Arathor for support. The two formed a military alliance in exchange for the instruction of 100 humans in arcane magic. Together, they crushed the Amani; an empire that had endured for more than twenty thousand years. Humans and high elves have cultivated this alliance ever since."

That purpose was eventually twisted into the Burning Crusade. Aeons into his crusade he encountered the magically powerful and technologically advanced Eredar. He cleverly deceived a number of them to join his Legion as Generals, promising power for their allegiance. Those who joined him were corrupted by Fel into the Man'ari demons. These Man'ari became the most powerful agents in the Legion, second only to Sargeras. Archimonde the Defiler and Kil'Jaeden the Deceiver were both Man'ari who offered supreme tactical leadership and personal power to the Legion."
 demonic_ideas_2: "The Burning Crusade"
 demonic_ideas_2_desc: "As a Titan, Sargeras fought many Void demons and imprisoned them in ancient times. When Sargeras looked at the infinite Void from which these demons came, he saw the threat of all Life in the universe being possessed by these demonic Fel powers. If that happened, even the Titans could not stop the corrupt power that would emerge in their universe. Sargeras vowed to destroy all life as an alternative to the corruption, and thus was born the Burning Crusade. Sargeras thought to use his own demon prisoners as an army against all life he would consume. He destroyed the demon's prison to set them free. However, the enormous release of Fel energies stored at the prison warped Sargeras into the incredibly powerful Fallen Fel Titan. He was empowered and emboldened by these infinite powers from the Void. He then began to use the Fel to corrupt warrior races, incorporating them into his newly formed Burning Legion, and then sending those troops to cleanse the planet of life. The Fel influence would grow across the planets themselves until the Energy would rip them apart. The Legion has spent aeons perfecting the art of war, incorporating the best warriors of every planet they have conquered. Planet by planet, the Burning Crusade has now arrived on Azeroth, the final planet to resist the Legion."

These energies immensely empower their user while simultaneously corrupting their body. Any time the Fel is used the land around also becomes corrupt. The Dark Portal and The Eye of Sargeras both permanently corrupted the land around them with Fel Energies."
 demonic_ideas_4: "Our Name is Legion, We are Many"
 demonic_ideas_4_desc: "The ranks of the Burning Legion are constituted of the nearly countless species they have conquered and corrupted across the universe. Some of these Fel-corrupt slave-species include the Man'ari Eredar, the Annihilan, the Nathrezim, the Ered'ruin, Orcs, Ogres, Undead, Imps, Mo'arg, Vrykul, Furbolgs, Voidwalkers, Satyrs, and Arrakoa, just to name a few. In addition to those corrupted by the Fel, the Legion has had many vassals serve them in the past. The Burning Legion was behind the creation of both the Horde and the Scourge. The Horde was manipulated to be the vanguard of the Legion's invasion into Azeroth from Outland, which was quickly falling into Fel destruction. After the failed invasion, the scattered orc tribes pursued various goals apart from the Legion, breaking free of their direct control. Needing a new plan, Sargeras created the enslaved Lich King from a former orc servant of his, Ner'Zhul. The Lich King quickly used his necromantic power to plan his own eventual revolt from the Legion, revolving around the young Prince Arthas Menethil."

These tough, enormous creatures were capable of inspiring both fear and order on the front lines. Mannoroth the Destructor is the most renowned of their rank. His powerful Fel demon-blood was personally used to corrupt the orcs at two different times. At both times he assumed ownership of all orcs, demanding their subservience whether it was offered or not. The Ered'ruin were a demon race used by the Titans to police users of magic across the cosmos. Sargeras freed these behemoths and formed them into the Doom Guard. They are the enforcers and shock troops of the Legion."

 mantid_ideas_5: "The Kunchong Cycle"
 mantid_ideas_5_desc:  "The cycle of mantid birthing and building revolves around the kunchong, a colossal insect large enough to threaten whole towns by itself. The mantid revere this enormous creature, and when instinct compels it to stampede throughout the continent, eating earth, trees, and lakes, they follow behind, collecting the amber-colored resin it secretes, birthing their young and creating their homes in its wake. "
 mantid_ideas_6: "Sonic Technology"
 mantid_ideas_6_desc: "Masters of sound, the mantid long ago found a way to use amber to extend the range of their acoustic casting. In this way they are able to communicate over vast distances.

 sindorei_ideas_6: "Ban'dinoriel and the Runestones"
 sindorei_ideas_6_desc: "Some times after the founding of Quel'Thalas, many of the high elves grew wary of their rampant use of arcane magic, fearing that it could once more draw the Burning Legion to Azeroth. Dath'Remar Sunstrider sent his most powerful arcanists to find a solution. Over several decades, they built a series of monolithic runestones around Quel'Thalas' borders. This barrier was called Ban'dinoriel, or 'the Gatekeeper' in the high elven tongue. It would prevent others from detecting the high elves' use of magic, ward off the superstitious Amani, and weaken the magic of all non-elves within it."
 sindorei_ideas_7: "Grand Magocracy"
 sindorei_ideas_7_desc: "\"The Magisters exact origin and time of ascension to authority are unknown, but it is presumed that they existed maybe before, or during the founding of Quel'Thalas. They have been Silvermoon's top authority on all things pertaining to magic, and have been in possession of a vast reservoir of knowledge on all things arcane, for many years. Like the Farstriders, the Magisters have been a cornerstone of Thalassian society for many years, and a common career choice for studious and ambitious elves. With Silvermoon in shambles it is only natural for them to fill the power vacuum."

 hlo_ideas_6: "Legacy of the Mogu Demise"

 burning_legion_ideas_1: "Legacy of Sargeras"
 burning_legion_ideas_1_desc: "Sargeras is an old and ancient being - a Titan. Originally he was a planet-sized creature made purely of arcane magic, tasked with keeping Order in the universe. That purpose was eventually twisted into the Burning Crusade. Aeons into his crusade he encountered the magically powerful and technologically advanced Eredar. He cleverly deceived a number of them to join his Legion as Generals, promising power for their allegiance. Those who joined him were corrupted by Fel into the Man'ari demons. These Man'ari became the most powerful agents in the Legion, second only to Sargeras. Archimonde the Defiler and Kil'Jaeden the Deceiver were both Man'ari who offered supreme tactical leadership and personal power to the Legion."
 burning_legion_ideas_2: "The Burning Crusade"
 burning_legion_ideas_2_desc: "As a Titan, Sargeras fought many Void demons and imprisoned them in ancient times. When Sargeras looked at the infinite Void from which these demons came, he saw the threat of all Life in the universe being possessed by these demonic Fel powers. If that happened, even the Titans could not stop the corrupt power that would emerge in their universe. Sargeras vowed to destroy all life as an alternative to the corruption, and thus was born the Burning Crusade. Sargeras thought to use his own demon prisoners as an army against all life he would consume. He destroyed the demon's prison to set them free. However, the enormous release of Fel energies stored at the prison warped Sargeras into the incredibly powerful Fallen Fel Titan. He was empowered and emboldened by these infinite powers from the Void. He then began to use the Fel to corrupt warrior races, incorporating them into his newly formed Burning Legion, and then sending those troops to cleanse the planet of life. The Fel influence would grow across the planets themselves until the Energy would rip them apart. The Legion has spent aeons perfecting the art of war, incorporating the best warriors of every planet they have conquered. Planet by planet, the Burning Crusade has now arrived on Azeroth, the final planet to resist the Legion."
 burning_legion_ideas_3: "Fel Energies"
 burning_legion_ideas_3_desc: "'A magic unlike any other that feeds on life itself. It promises great power but exacts a great price.' - Medivh    When Sargeras released the demons, he tore a rift in the fabric of the universe directly into the fiery emerald green Void, from which the Fel Energies come. These energies immensely empower their user while simultaneously corrupting their body. Any time the Fel is used the land around also becomes corrupt. The Dark Portal and The Eye of Sargeras both permanently corrupted the land around them with Fel Energies."
 burning_legion_ideas_4: "Our Name is Legion, We are Many"
 burning_legion_ideas_4_desc: "The ranks of the Burning Legion are constituted of the nearly countless species they have conquered and corrupted across the universe. Some of these Fel-corrupt slave-species include the Man'ari Eredar, the Annihilan, the Nathrezim, the Ered'ruin, Orcs, Ogres, Undead, Imps, Mo'arg, Vrykul, Furbolgs, Voidwalkers, Satyrs, and Arrakoa, just to name a few. In addition to those corrupted by the Fel, the Legion has had many vassals serve them in the past. The Burning Legion was behind the creation of both the Horde and the Scourge. The Horde was manipulated to be the vanguard of the Legion's invasion into Azeroth from Outland, which was quickly falling into Fel destruction. After the failed invasion, the scattered orc tribes pursued various goals apart from the Legion, breaking free of their direct control. Needing a new plan, Sargeras created the enslaved Lich King from a former orc servant of his, Ner'Zhul. The Lich King quickly used his necromantic power to plan his own eventual revolt from the Legion, revolving around the young Prince Arthas Menethil."
 burning_legion_ideas_5: "The Mighty Infernals"
 burning_legion_ideas_5_desc: "Few mortals in Azeroth were prepared for the Infernals. Arriving through the skies as fiery-green meteors, these living siege engines were a vanguard of both Sargeras' ancient army and Archimonde's more recent invasionary forces. Few, if any, can stand against the might of the Legion's many Fel constructs. Variations of these constructs include the Infernals, Abyssals, Fel Reavers, Fel Cannons, and Devastators."
 burning_legion_ideas_6: "Nathrezim Lieutenants"
 burning_legion_ideas_6_desc: "An intelligent race of psychic vampires, renowned for their cunning, scheming, and versatility. Also quite renowned for their treachery. While effective intelligent agents and field lieutenants, if given even a bit of power these creatures will try to abuse it. A few Nathrezim were even willing to betray the Legion and Sargeras for their own goals."
 burning_legion_ideas_7: "The Annihilan and Ered'Ruin"
 burning_legion_ideas_7_desc: "The powerful Annihilan, commonly referred to as Pit Lords, were some of Sargeras' highest ranking commanders in the Legion. These tough, enormous creatures were capable of inspiring both fear and order on the front lines. Mannoroth the Destructor is the most renowned of their rank. His powerful Fel demon-blood was personally used to corrupt the orcs at two different times. At both times he assumed ownership of all orcs, demanding their subservience whether it was offered or not. The Ered'ruin were a demon race used by the Titans to police users of magic across the cosmos. Sargeras freed these behemoths and formed them into the Doom Guard. They are the enforcers and shock troops of the Legion."

 sons_of_lothar_ideas_1_desc: "Khadgar was the first member among the leaders of the sons to know Lothar, it were the young mages' words and proof gleaned from his time at Karazhan that convinced the aged knight of Medivh's treachery. Years after the death of Anduin Lothar and first defeat of the Orcish Horde by the united Alliance, orcs that didn't take part in the second war have come for magical artifacts from Azeroth. Medivh's assistance was crucial to stop the destructive power that was ripping apart Draenor due to the folly of the orcs from doing the same to Azeroth thanks to the open Dark Portal. Medivh closed the portal on Draenor's side due to the lack of time, stranding the alliance expeditionary force into the orcish homeworld with no way to return and as long as they would keep the orcs at bay, the longer would their home be untouched by orcish hand."

The resolution to his problem of faith came from the mouth of the very Warchief of the Horde after the orc had slain Lothar in single combat, where he proclaimed that the Horde will conquer Azeroth as their new world, thus allowing Turalyon to understand that the horde, the monsters that they were, were invaders from another world that dared despoil Azeroth. By the time of the expedition Turalyon's faith was firm and certain, he would read to the men from the mysteries of the light, later returning the book to a priest of newly established Honor Hold before disappearing during the end of Draenor…"

Some time after the second war ended, the dark portal reappeared and orcs invaded again, this time focused on looting relics. Alleria joined the expedition forces to make certain that the horde would never dare threaten the woodlands of quel'thalas. During the shattering of Draenor, she entered the same portal as Turalyon and was never heard from again…"

 sons_of_lothar_ideas_4_desc: "During the second war Kurdran was the High Thane of the Wildhammer clan, one of the three main groups of dwarves, known for their gryphon riding skills and ferocity in combat while wielding storm hammers. The wildhammers were invaded by orc and troll forces and later were relieved by the alliance army, thus pledging their ferocity on the land, above the sea and in the sky to the alliance forces. During the war, the rider and his gryphon had slain nine dragons. When the news of the dragon Deathwing breaching through the dark portal into Dreanor came, Kurdran joined the mounting alliance expedition."
 sons_of_lothar_ideas_5: "Danath's Discipline"
 sons_of_lothar_ideas_5_desc: "Nephew to the king of Stromgarde, the militarist human kingdom, Danath was a veteran mercenary captain in his homeland's militia, when the Second war begun he was appointed as a tactical advisor to Turalyon, after the war he became overseer of the internment camps in Azeroth based at New Stormwind. After the horde returned, he took half the garrison and all the mercenaries in Stormwind, only to lose them all in an event where they sacrificed themselves so that he may survive and warn Khadgar, the guilt of losing his boys had further steeled him to fight against the orcs. After Draenor broke apart, with Turalyon and Alleria gone, Khadgar busy at trying to unite people against the Burning Legion, it was left to Danath to lead the Sons of Lothar for the two decades locked in constant conflict against the orcs."
 sons_of_lothar_ideas_6: "Holding the line"
 sons_of_lothar_ideas_6_desc: "For twenty years the line was held, no matter the pain and death. The soldiers of the Sons of Lothar fought against the orcs in defence of their homeworld, being the only line stopping the beasts from reaching the dark portal, until it was opened from the opposite side…."

 sons_of_lothar_ideas_7_desc: "After the Dark Portal was reopened by the Doomlord Kazzak, forces of the Alliance came to Outland once they had beaten back an invasion. They found the Sons of Lothar still fighting and flooded to their aid against the Legion and other great dangers that had befallen the shattered husk of the once world."

 marauder_ideas_6_desc: "We take what is our just due, for these lands belong to the Centaur. The brambles of the Quillboar, the hides of the Tauren, the wood of the Night Elves, even the scales of the wretched black dragonflight shall become our armour, our weaponry and our fuel. Take all you can, and give nothing back!"
 marauder_ideas_7: "The True Khan"
 marauder_ideas_7_desc: "Many false Khans claim to be the True Khan of the centaur. The Galak, the Gelkis, the Mauradine. But we have stretched our lands from coast to coast. We have hunted the hunters and salted the lands with the blood of lesser races. Our khanate does not merely boast a claim, it has the power to back those claims. The Centaur Marauders shall be the only clan. Our Khan is the only True Khan."
