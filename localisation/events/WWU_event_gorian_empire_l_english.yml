 wwu_gorian_empire.1.desc: "At long last our ancient capital of Goria is under Ogre rule again. Much has changed since we last ruled this land and the our horrible enemy the Draenei have changed it beyond recognition. Now our people are at a crossroads we can continue as we are now the descendents of ancient titan creations and restore order to all of Draenor but there have been whispering among the populace that we should abandon the old way and align ourself with newer and stronger forces so that we will not fall like we did before. We can of course ignore these people and keep to our roots but there are some that say we should embrace the fel just like the Orcs. Those pathetic weaklings arent worthy to wield such power and would stand little chance against us if we wielded it too. But there are others that say we should learn from our ancient enemy the Draenei and embrace the light, to purge this land of all chaos and unholiness. But on the opposite spectrum many Ogres have begun hearing whispers from a world far away calling for us to embrace a power never seen in this world before. And recent discoveries in Arcane magics have found a previously unheard of path of necromantic magic"
