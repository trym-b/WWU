 wwu_mission_gilneas.2.desc: "After some hesitation, Lord Godfrey personally came to convince King [Root.Monarch.GetName] to join the Alliance of Lordaeron and send our forces to support the Alliance's war effort. However, this would mean committing our soldiers to war and possibly losing them. The king's skepticism contrasts with Godfrey's arguments in favor of integrating into the military Alliance, both to preserve our diplomatic and trade relations and to remain in good standing with its members. On the other hand, the king is confident that he can contain the Horde on his own, should the threat ever loom over the kingdom."

Sparked by dissent against the decisions of King Genn Greymane, particularly his isolationist policies and the construction of the Greymane Wall, the rebellion was led by disgruntled noble families and citizens who felt abandoned by their ruler. Tensions escalated as the rebels sought to overthrow the monarchy and take control of the northern regions of Gilneas.

As the time has come to decide his fate, the people and leaders of Gilneas are divided on how to handle the former traitor. Should he be punished for his betrayal and the suffering he caused, or should the kingdom move past his transgressions and focus on healing and unity? The decision will shape the future of Gilneas and determine whether the scars of the rebellion will ever fully heal."

The establishment of internment camps for orcs, a project supported by Lordaeron, is a growing source of dissent. Gilneas, already reluctant to fully engage in Alliance affairs, views these camps as a colossal waste of resources and money. King [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] believes that this financial burden could weaken his kingdom, and that the captive orcs should be executed or exiled, not imprisoned.
