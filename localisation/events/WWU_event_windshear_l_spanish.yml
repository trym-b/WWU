 wwu_windshear.1.title: "A rising star"
 wwu_windshear.1.desc: "It is not often that a single Kobold rises to prominense so quickly as the new rising star that is Togwaggle. He has gained both the respect and admiration of many Kobolds much to the frustration of our current Chief who feels only jealousy as many Kobolds look up more to Togwaggle than to the Chief. Prehaps this will only be a short lived trend or a potential future threath that will need to be dealt with"

 wwu_windshear.8.title: "What to do with the remaining rebels"
 wwu_windshear.8.desc: "While the battle and war is won there are still those who had thrown their lot in with Togwaggle that still resist and will need to be dealt with. This makes for an execellent oppurtonity to make an example of the remaining rebels to keep this from happening again. They have been isolated into a section of the cave that could take months to take back, or we could just collapse the caves down on them"

We bathe in gold and have enough money to keep our caves lit up and the darkness away from us. But with incredibly wealth come some unforseen problems, gold simply isnt worth as much anymore. To combat this it has been suggested by the richer Kobolds to force lowe clas Kobolds to throw away part of their money while we can keep our gold hoards as they are"

None would have ever thought a cave dwelling people like us could ever rise to such heights yet here we stand at the top of the world with treasures from all over Azeroth flooding into our caves.

One may think this is enough but it is never enough, it wont be enough until every piece of Gold on this planet has been dug up and become a part of our treasury. Even the poorest of Kobolds wear clothes decorated in Gold, we have more Gold than food and while outsiders critisise the value of our Gold we know they are just jealous! Gold would never lose value, it is too beautiful too precious to do so. And now all the gold shall belong to us!"
