 wwu_nazmir.1.title: "First Blood Matron"
 wwu_nazmir.1.desc: "In the shadowed groves of Nazmir, the blood moon rises, marking the time of choosing. From the depths of the swamps, a new leader emerges, chosen by the whispers of G'huun.[ROOT.Monarch.GetName], the Blood Matron, now destined to lead her kin in a sacred quest. Her vision is clear - to awaken G'huun and bring about the fall of the Zandalari's Golden Throne. The drums of war beat in the hearts of the Blood Trolls, echoing her call to arms. It's time to consolidate power and unite the Nazmir region. Will the world tremble before their might?"
 wwu_nazmir.1.op1: "Let's start worshiping G'huun"
 
 wwu_nazmir.2.title: "Sacrificial Altar"
 wwu_nazmir.2.desc: "Deep in the swamps, the blood troll village of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] is terrifying. A sacrificial altar was built in its heart, a place of dark rituals and bloody offerings to G'huun.\nG'huun's followers, the blood trolls, prepare for a ceremony that will bring them the power and favor of their cruel god. Enemies of the cult, caught in constant conflict, are to be sacrificed so that their screams and suffering may be a tribute to G'huun. But it's not just the enemies that will be sacrificed; also the men of the tribe will have the "honor" to join their opponents on the altar."
 wwu_nazmir.2.op1: "Bring the victims!"
