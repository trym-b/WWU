Blood trolls, plague the borders of the empire, spreading havoc and fear into the hearts of its inhabitants. With each passing day, as the sun sinks below the horizon, blood trolls go on the hunt, attacking villages and caravans, kidnapping victims for their dark rituals. The empire, already weakened by internal conflicts and political intrigues, is barely able to maintain its positions. In desperation, the King of Zandalar decides to make a reluctant deal with the blood trolls. In exchange for a fragile ceasefire, the empire must pay tribute - gold - to ensure temporary peace. This solution, although controversial, seems to be the only way to avoid an open war that the empire is unable to win. However, each tribute paid to the bloodtrolls only strengthens their position and courage, and the king realizes that this is only temporary relief. He must find a lasting solution before the blood trolls become too powerful to stop."

But in the eyes of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] there is greed not only for gold, but also for blood. Among Zandalar's emissaries are strong warriors who could serve as powerful sacrifices for G'huun. Their screams and pain could be a powerful gift that would please the god and bring even greater power to the tribe. Will the blood trolls choose temporary wealth or the long-lasting power of their sacrifices? The choice is in [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] hands, and the consequences will be felt by the entire tribe."

Additionally, buried on the island by a great cataclysm caused by the eruption of the well of eternity, the Zandalari lost its position to the younger races, burying itself in decadence. The policy of our King Rastakhan does not indicate that anything will change in this matter. The radicalist and patriot §YProphet Zul§!, bored with the passivity of our king, will try to repair the country on his own. Our main goal is to get our kingdom back on track, with Zandalari becoming an empire again not only in name."
