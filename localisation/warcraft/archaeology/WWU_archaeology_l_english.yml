For more than a thousand years, an old and cunning mo'arg has used the axe to butcher uprisings and consume the life force of the Legion's foes. Over its long and infamous history, the weapon has made its demonic bearer extraordinarily powerful.\nWe have the opportunity to traverse a fel portal and enter the world of Gorelix the Fleshripper, allowing us to claim this artifact."

 wwu_artifact_unlocks.3.desc: "Crafted by the Burning Legion to corrupt the world of Azeroth, the soul-stealing runeblade Frostmourne was shattered by Ashbringer atop Icecrown Citadel. Countless souls were freed from the broken blade, but others were not so fortunate. Today the shards of Frostmourne can be recrafted and infused with even more power. However, the spirits still trapped within must first be subdued and bent to the wielder's will.\nThe Scourge have fallen and Frostmourne is shattered. Let us re-forge it into a weapon of our own."

 wwu_artifact_unlocks.4.title: "Aldrachi Warblades"
 wwu_artifact_unlocks.4.desc: "In ages past, the dark titan, Sargeras, offered the mighty aldrachi people a place in his Burning Legion. But the aldrachi proved incorruptible: they slew innumerable demons before their race was wiped out. Sargeras personally killed their greatest champion and seized his weapons. Much later, a demon hunter willingly became the servant of Sargeras' lieutenant Kil'jaeden. Pleased, Kil'jaeden bestowed the warblades on her, that she might wield a portion of the aldrachi's bygone might, and devastate the mortals of Azeroth with it.\nWe have the opportunity to traverse a fel portal and enter the world of Caria Felsoul, allowing us to claim this artifact."

 wwu_artifact_unlocks.5.desc: "As beings of Holy Light, the benevolent naaru rescued the draenei from their homeworld after most of its people were transformed into demonic recruits for the Burning Legion. Demons nearly overwhelmed the fleeing draenei, but the naaru protected the refugees with this beacon crystal. Tuure channels the Light's essence into healing radiance, regenerating horrific wounds and bringing people back from the brink of death. Ultimately the crystal was lost to Legion forces on an invaded world. It hasn't been seen since.\nWe have the opportunity to traverse a fel portal and enter the a forgotten Legion world, allowing us to claim this artifact."

 wwu_artifact_unlocks.6.desc: "Goremaw the Devourer, Sargeras' personal hound, claimed countless lives before it was eventually ambushed and killed on another world long ago. Following the hound's death, Mephistroph had its fangs crafted into two powerful daggers that still carried with them some of the potent withering essence that made Goremaw's bites so deadly. These daggers were passed to Akaari, one of Sargeras' most deadly assassins, who wields them to this day.\nWe have the opportunity to traverse a fel portal and enter the world of Akaari, allowing us to claim this artifact."
